## 🧠 About Me

Hi 👋 I'm a Master's student in AI at Chung-Ang University.

My research focuses on **Anomaly Detection**, and I am particularly interested in

developing **interpretable AI systems** using **multi-modal models and LLMs**.

🔬 Research Interests

- Interpretable AI with Multi-modal Models & LLMs
- Retrieval-Augmented Models (Incorporating External Knowledge into AI Systems)
- Anomaly Detection ()

### 🧪 Current Research Focus

- Designing interpretable anomaly detection frameworks using multi-modal data
- Exploring effective ways to integrate external knowledge via retrieval mechanisms
- Leveraging LLMs to enhance reasoning and explainability in AI models
