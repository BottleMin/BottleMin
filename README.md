- My research focuses on **Anomaly Detection**, and I am particularly interested in 
developing **interpretable AI systems** using **multi-modal models and LLMs**.

## 🔬 Research Interests

- Interpretable AI with Multi-modal Models & LLMs
- Retrieval-Augmented Models (Incorporating External Knowledge into AI Systems)
- Industrial Anomaly Detection

## 🧪 Current Research Focus

- Designing interpretable anomaly detection frameworks using multi-modal data
- Exploring effective ways to integrate external knowledge via retrieval mechanisms
- Leveraging LLMs to enhance reasoning and explainability in AI models
